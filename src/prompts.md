I'm struggling with [this types (as in js's this)] in [typescript]. Give me: 1. THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES - Show me code that sucks WITHOUT this concept (the pain point) 2. THE SIMPLEST WORKING EXAMPLE - Minimum viable code that I can type and run 3. PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES - 3-4 examples to type out, each adding ONE new aspect 4. WHAT BREAKS - Show me error cases so I understand the boundaries 5. THE REAL-WORLD VERSION - One actual example I'd see in production code Requirements: - Every example must be runnable in VS Code - Start with the absolute simplest case - Each example should build on the previous one - Include comments showing what to hover over or what errors to expect - include the theory as an addendum at the end- initially just show me what to type and what happens
